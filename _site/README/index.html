<p>[COURSEDESCRIPTION]</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add <code>/tree/BRANCH_NAME</code> to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.</p>
<h2>Branches</h2>
<p>The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is <code>CHAPTER#_MOVIE#</code>. As an example, the branch named <code>02_03</code> corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters <code>b</code> for &quot;beginning&quot; and <code>e</code> for &quot;end&quot;. The <code>b</code> branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The <code>e</code> branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The <code>master</code> branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.</p>
